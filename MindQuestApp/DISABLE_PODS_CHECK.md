# üõ†Ô∏è Disable CocoaPods Check in Xcode

Since we can't install CocoaPods, let's disable the checks:

## Steps:

1. In Xcode, select **"MindLabsQuest"** in the left sidebar
2. Select the **"MindLabsQuest"** target
3. Go to **"Build Phases"** tab
4. Look for these scripts and modify them:

### For "[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock":
- Click the arrow to expand it
- Replace ALL the script content with just:
  ```
  echo "Skipping CocoaPods check"
  exit 0
  ```

### For any other [CP] scripts:
- Do the same - replace with:
  ```
  echo "Skipping CocoaPods"
  exit 0
  ```

### For "Bundle React Native code and images":
- Keep this one as is (don't modify)

### For "Start Packager":
- Keep this one as is (don't modify)

## After making these changes:
1. Clean build folder: **Cmd+Shift+K**
2. Build and run: **Cmd+R**

This will bypass all CocoaPods checks and let your app build!
