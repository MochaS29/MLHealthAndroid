# ðŸ”§ Fix Xcode Build Warnings

These warnings won't stop your app from running, but here's how to fix them:

## In Xcode:

### Fix "Start Packager" Warning:
1. In the left sidebar, click on **"MindLabsQuest"** (the blue project icon)
2. Select **"MindLabsQuest"** under TARGETS
3. Go to **"Build Phases"** tab
4. Find **"Start Packager"** (it has a shell icon)
5. Click the arrow to expand it
6. âœ… Check the box: **"Based on dependency analysis"**
7. Or uncheck **"Based on dependency analysis"** to run it every time

### Fix "Bundle React Native code and images" Warning:
1. Still in **"Build Phases"**
2. Find **"Bundle React Native code and images"**
3. Click the arrow to expand it
4. âœ… Uncheck **"Based on dependency analysis"**
   (This one should run every build to bundle your JavaScript)

## Alternative Quick Fix:
Just ignore these warnings! They don't affect functionality at all. Your app will still:
- Build successfully âœ…
- Run on your iPhone âœ…
- Work perfectly âœ…

## What these scripts do:
- **Start Packager**: Starts the Metro bundler (JavaScript server)
- **Bundle React Native**: Packages your JavaScript code into the app

Both need to run for your app to work, and they're already configured correctly!

**TIP**: Focus on getting your app running first. You can always fix these cosmetic warnings later!
