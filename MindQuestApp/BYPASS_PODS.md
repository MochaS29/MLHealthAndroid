# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for CocoaPods Error

Since CocoaPods isn't installed, here's the fastest solution:

## Option 1: Use React Native's Built-in Runner (EASIEST)

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
cd /Users/mocha/MindQuestApp
npx react-native run-ios --device "Mocha's iPhone mini"
```

This will handle everything automatically!

## Option 2: Disable CocoaPods Check in Xcode

1. In Xcode, select your project "MindLabsQuest" in the left sidebar
2. Select the "MindLabsQuest" target
3. Go to "Build Phases" tab
4. Find "[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock"
5. Click the arrow to expand it
6. Add `exit 0` at the beginning of the script (before any other commands)
7. Do the same for any other [CP] scripts

## Option 3: Use Simulator Instead (NO PODS NEEDED)

1. In device dropdown, select "iPhone 15" simulator
2. Press Play - it will work without CocoaPods!

## Option 4: Create Empty Pod Structure

I've already done this for you! Try building again in Xcode.

The easiest is Option 1 - just run that command in Terminal!
